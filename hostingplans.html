				<h2>Choosing the right Hosting Plan </h2>
			
            <p>
                Hosting services are going to vary. They go from free, to what I call midrange, to really full service. And so, you need to decide what kind of hosting service best fits you. To be honest, I usually recommend free when you're getting started, and then make your way up. But let's talk about the pros and cons of each one.
            </p>
            <p>
                With free services, you really have little or no control over your domain name. So if you go and look at some other people's, particularly from your school, your work, things where people are not really there just for the domain name, and you're gonna see things like wicks.whatever.whatever and then your name.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're going to have really limited tools. Sometimes when you pay for a site, you're gonna be able to have email registration and different things like that. Free services don't really wanna give you too much freedom because they're a little worried about what you're gonna do. Probably the worst part about free services is that there's a lot of advertising and redirects. If somebody goes to your site and makes the smallest little typo, rather than getting a nice friendly warning, they're probably going to be redirected to some somebody trying to sell something.
            </p>
            <p>
                The nice part about free services is that they have a very familiar look and feel across all of them. If you sign up for one service and learn how to do your hosting on it, you can pretty much rest assured that you're gonna be able to manipulate your files on any other free service as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                So let's talk about paid services, both the mid range and the full. With paid services, you tend to have much better tools for manipulating your code. It's not just about putting your files up on the web. You can do things like have email filters, send out special, what we call cron jobs. Cron jobs are different files that you can run at different times of the day. So if you wanna have a database, you wanna have a list server, you wanna have emails, then you might wanna pay for the paid services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other really nice thing about paid services is that there's technical support available to you. So you can go ahead and email, chat, anything you need. You're not gonna find that with the free services, or it just won't be quite as good.
            </p>
            <p>
                But before you go for the paid services, I really recommend that you check for free services.A lot of time these free services still have the really great tools and the support, but you just don't have to pay for them. So, if in the end you're not quite sure what you want to do, if you want to go with free or paid, I know it can be overwhelming when you decide what you're gonna do. So I've simply recommended one site that I know a lot of people who are still learning use and that is GITHUB or BYETHOST.
                I have included a link on top which explains how to host your own website on github.
                For paid services you can goahead to the following links and checkout their pricing.

            </p>
            <h3>1. Bluehost – Best Overall</h3>
            <p>Bluehost web hosting has been around since 2007 and they now host more than 3,000,000 websites. They are the most popular, low-cost hosting option for new websites.

                They are our top-rated web hosting company because their last 24-month uptime and speed are very strong – 99.99% and 405 ms, respectively.
                
                Their 3-year introductory price is $2.75/mo (renews $7.95) and that comes with features like free domain name, website builder and one-click install for WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal through cPanel. So for starters (someone without a website), this is probably the best option. Unmetered bandwidth and 50 GB storage are included in the basic plan.
                
                It’s a great fit for WordPress websites since it’s officially recommended by WordPress.org
                
                Bluehost also free email accounts, 24/7 live customer support and SSL (security layer) on all plans. It’s very easy to use and probably the best entry-level web hosting provider that is both reliable and secure. In addition to traditional shared hosting, the company also offers dedicated, VPS and managed WordPress hosting plans for higher traffic websites.
                
                All of their hosting plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee and get instantly activated, so you can start using them right away.

            </p>
            <h3>2. HostGator Cloud – Best Cheap Cloud</h3>
            <p>
                HostGator, founded in 2002, is a popular shared and cloud hosting provider that is currently hosting over 2,000,000 websites.

According to our last 24-month data, HostGator Cloud has a strong uptime (99.99%) and above-average speed (399 ms) making it a strong contender to Bluehost.

HostGator offers flexible features, such as unlimited email account, unmetered bandwidth, unmetered disk space and built-in cache on all plans. Furthermore, all of their hosting plans come with a 99.9% uptime guarantee, free SSL certificate, easy WordPress installs, and a free domain for a year (when you sign up for 12, 24 or 36 months).

If you want to build a custom website, you can do so with the Gator Website Builder. It’s a HostGator’s drag and drop website builder designed to be an easy, eCommerce-friendly site builder for beginners.

HostGator’s cheapest plan starts from $2.74/mo (when you choose a 12-month payment plan) and renews $10.95/mo. Other than shared cloud hosting, HostGator offers WordPress, VPS and dedicated hosting plans serving all size organizations from small businesses to enterprise websites.

All plans come with a generous 45-day money-back guarantee.

            <h3>3.Hostinger – Cheapest Price</h3>

                Our last 24-month data shows that Hostinger has an average uptime of 99.95%, but a very fast average loading time of 350 ms making it the best cheap web hosting you can find.

Hostinger (who also owns Hosting24) offers extremely affordable hosting plans without compromising too much on the quality and performance of the service. While it’s cheap on the price, the features that come with Hostinger’s plans will appeal to many beginner website owners.

The company offers a variety of hosting plans with different features and all plans come with an easy website builder, free SSL certificate, 99.9% uptime guarantee and 24/7/365 support.

Hostinger’s cheapest plan starts from just $0.99/mo (when you choose a 48-month payment plan), renewals start at $2.15/mo. Bandwidth and databases are unlimited unless you choose the “Single Web Hosting” plan. With the latter you’ll be limited to 10GB of disk space, 100GB of bandwidth, one MySQL database, and one email account. Most notably, the cheapest plan doesn’t include a free domain and has limited processing power and memory.

Other services provided by Hostinger include Cloud, Email, WordPress, VPS, Windows VPS hosting.

<h3>4. GreenGeeks – Best “Green” Hosting</h3>
            <p>
                GreenGeeks has been around 12+ years and hosts over 500,000 websites.

                With 99.98% uptimes and load speeds of 445 ms, GreenGeeks offers fast and reliable hosting at an affordable rate of $2.95/month. Add to this their feature-rich bonuses, high-quality 24/7 customer support, and environmentally friendly practices and it’s easy to see how GreenGeeks are quickly carving out a name for themselves in a wildly oversaturated market.
                
                All plans come with a free domain for 1 year, cPanel access, free Wildcard SSL, PowerCacher, unlimited SSD storage, and unlimited data transfer. Customers also get an unlimited number of domain names, unlimited email accounts, and nightly backups.
                
                If your website grows bigger, you can always upgrade to their more flexible VPS hosting. Also, GreenGeeks will migrate your site from your existing web host for free. Unfortunately, the $9.95/month renewal rate may dissuade some webmasters from choosing GreenGeeks over other hosting providers.
                
                All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

<h3>5. DreamHost – Pay Monthly, No Higher Renewals</h3>

                Founded in 1996, DreamHost is one of the oldest web hosting providers. The company hosts over 1.5 million websites, blogs, and applications in more than 100 countries.

According to our last 24-month data, DreamHost has an average uptime (99.94%) and adequate speed (648 ms) making it a reliable hosting solution.

What makes DreamHost different from many other web hosting services is that they offer an option to pay monthly instead of yearly.

This means you can sign up for $4.95 and start using your hosting account right away. Alternatively, you can opt-in for a 3-year-plan which starts at $2.59/mo and renews at $4.95/mo. The basic plan includes a free domain, 1 website, unlimited bandwidth, and 50 GB SSD storage. Customers also get to use DreamHost’s drag-and-drop builder and can add an email for a monthly fee of $1.67/mo.

The company offers strong security features (LetsEncrypt SSL), a variety of domain management tools and unlimited data transfer per month. WordPress comes pre-installed and the company also has its own easy-to-use and beginner-friendly website builder. They don’t have cPanel which is well known in the web developers industry, but DreamHost offers their own admin panel which pretty much does the same as cPanel or Plesk.

<h3>7. A2 Hosting – Fastest Shared Hosting</h3>
            <p>
                US-based A2 Hosting (founded in 2002, hosting 500,000+ websites) is the fastest shared web hosting we’ve tested to date. They’ve managed to achieve an impressive 317 ms average load time over a period of 24-months.

A2 Hosting is fast because their servers are optimized for WordPress websites and they use LiteSpeed cache. Since we’ve reviewed more than 30+ shared web hosting companies, none of them are fast as A2.

Despite being the fastest, A2 isn’t as reliable. Their average uptime has been hovering around ~99.93%. It’s not much, but it’s more than ~6 hours of downtime each year.

The A2 hosting company is well-known for working seamlessly with all major content management systems including WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, OpenCart and Magento making it a great fit for web developers. The company offers a variety of hosting plans and they all include a free LetsEncrypt SSL certificate, unlimited SSD storage, and free site migration.

The cheapest plan “Lite” starts $2.96/mo (renews $7.99/mo) comes with 1 website, 25 email accounts, a domain name for 1 year, free Cloudflare CDN and unlimited bandwidth/disk space.

A2 Hosting has a reliable customer support team called “Guru Crew Support.” Customers can connect with them 24/7/365 via live chat, phone, email, and tickets. Next to regular, shared hosting, they also offer dedicated, VPS and reseller hosting for webmasters.

All plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

<h3>8. WestHost</h3>
            <p>
                WestHost is a hosting company that is owned by thgingenuity Ltd. (UK company) which also owns MidPhase.

Our recent data show that WestHost has had an average uptime of 99.98% and a load time of 881 ms. We have seen that their speed hasn’t been among the top 15. However, due to their cheap pricing (starts $1.99/mo for a 3-year plan and renews $4.99/mo) and free CDN with site backups makes them a good hosting provider in the top 10.

Their uptime is above-average which makes WestHost a good option for small online business websites considering that it’s one of the cheapest web hosting solutions on the market – $1.99/mo for a 3-year plan.

Unfortunately, SSL and free domains are not included. If you want them from free, you’ll need to choose their higher-tier plan “Preferred”. The cheapest plan gives you FTP access only, so you are unable to use quick installs for CMS like WordPress making it a difficult choice for beginners.

Unlike other, more popular hosting services, WestHost only offers a standard shared hosting provider. So if your website grows, you’ll likely need to transfer your sites away from WestHost.


<a href="https://hostingfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Westhost-homepage-768x372.jpg"><img src="https://hostingfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Westhost-homepage-768x372.jpg" /> </a>

</p>
<h3>9. GoDaddy Hosting</h3>
            <p>
                GoDaddy is one of the leading hosting solutions powering over 44 million websites. The company has 14 facilities around the globe and is recognized as one of the largest domain registrars. They also offer web hosting services that are suitable for both small and very big websites. Similarly to SiteGround, they also don’t own their server park, instead they are partnered with Amazon and rent servers from AWS.

The last 2 years of tracking GoDaddy shared hosting has shown us an uptime of 99.97% and page speed around 554 ms which shows us that GoDaddy is a reliable provider. GoDaddy is an excellent solution for building custom websites as it comes with a simple drag-and-drop website builder (GoCentral) designed for beginners. It also features developer-friendly tools like MySQL, cPanel, CloudLinux, Python, and multiple versions of PHP.

Their cheapest web hosting plan starts from $4.33/mo (renews $8.99/mo) comes with 100GB of website storage (a lot) and unmetered bandwidth. Security monitoring and DDoS protection are included too.

However, GoDaddy has many “upsells” that will likely make you pay a bit more. For example, site backups, SSL certificates, and email accounts are not included in their cheapest plan. GoDaddy also offers 24/7 support.

All GoDaddy’s yearly and multi-year plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee.
